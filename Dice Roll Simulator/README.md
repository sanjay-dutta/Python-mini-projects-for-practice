# Dice Roll Simulator

The random module in the Python programming language can be used to select a random integer between 1 and 6 for the Dice Roll Simulation. You have access to all of the functions in the random module once you import it. Although the list is somewhat lengthy, we'll utilise the random.randint() function in this case. Based on the start and finish values that we provide, this function outputs an integer at random.
This logic can be used to imitate a dice roll because the smallest and greatest values of a dice roll are 1 and 6, respectively. This provides the start and finish numbers for the random.randint() function that we will employ. Let's now look at how Python can mimic a dice roll.
