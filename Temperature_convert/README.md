# Python Program To Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

Converting temperatures is easy to calculate. Since the starting points for Celsius and Fahrenheit are different (0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit), we must convert the temperature. Therefore, to convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius, all we need to do is take 32 out of it.
The size of the units can vary at times as well. Since Fahrenheit splits the range between the freezing and boiling points of water into 180 degrees rather than 100 degrees as it does in Celsius, I will also multiply the amount by 5/9 in order to convert 180 degrees to 100.
