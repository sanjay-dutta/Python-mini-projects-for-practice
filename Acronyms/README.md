# Create Acronyms using Python

A term's acronym is a condensed version of a longer word or phrase, for as "NLP" for "natural language processing."

In the code above, I first take a string input from the user before splitting the sentence using Python's split() method. I then created a new variable called "a" to hold a phrase's acronym. I then perform a for loop on the variable "text," which represents the division of user input, at the end. The upper() function is used to convert the index value of str[0] of each word following a split into uppercase while the for loop is running.
