# Alarm Clock with Python

I'll be creating an alarm clock for this assignment in Python using the DateTime module, and I'll play the alarm sound in Python using the sound library.
Python comes with the DateTime module preconfigured, making it simple to import it into your programme. Using the pip command, pip install playsound, it is simple to install the playsound library.Python's built-in DateTime module makes it simple to incorporate it into your programme.
